# Future Work
## Added integrations
- **Datadog integration**: Ingest data from Datadog to enable Sentinel to create work items based on Datadog logs and events.
- **Sync with popular task management systems**: Allow created work items to be automatically synced with popular task management platforms such as:
  - Trello
  - Jira
  - GitHub Issues
  - Slack Tasks

## LLM Layer
- Implement a Large Language Model (LLM) layer to enhance work item description generation and improve deduplication of similar log events.
- Explore the LLM's ability to analyze patterns in log data for more intelligent incident descriptions and possible solutions.
