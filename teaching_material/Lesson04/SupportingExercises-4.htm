<H2>1</H2>
<P>
<H4>Write and test an apllication which contains a class that again contains a method that throws an exception.<br>
Make an object of this class in Main().<br>
Notice what happen if this exception is not caught!
<br>
Solve the problem with a try-catch construction.<br>
<BR></H4>
<H2>2</H2>
<P>
<H4>In lesson 3, exercise 2 you wrote a simple class for file manipulation. Expand this class to have exception handling.<BR>
Remember to use finally (for closing a file etc.).<BR></H4>
<H2>3</H2>
<P>
<H4>
It is not legal to divide by zero: In the division algorithm of the complex class (lesson 2) you should handle this problem.<br>

<BR></H4>

<H2>4</H2>
<P>
<H4>Write and test an interface : IVehicle<br>
IVehicle ensures the following methods:<br>
<ul>

<li>int GetVehicleId()</li>
<li>string GetName()</li>
<li>string GetVehicleType()</li>
</ul>
Write the classes Bus and Car and let those two classes implement the interface.<br>
The constructor fills an int: vehicleId, a string: name and a string: vehicleType.<br>
Make several objects of the classes. Check if the interface is implemented. 
</H4>

<H2>5</H2>
<P>
<H4>An old - and not especially advanced - way to decide how difficult a programming task is is to calculate Function Points:
<br>
The idea was to calculate the number of lines with a level of difficulty <br>
(example: Factors: 3,6,9) can be used for calculation.<br>
Example:<br>
10 lines of code with factor 3 = 30 p<br>
15 lines of code with factor 6 = 90 p<br>
Write and test a simple class that implement IComparable for <br>
listning of the work (starting with greatest FP).<br>
The class ( name for instance FP ) contains the variables:<br>
int numberOfLines<br>
int factor<br>
Make several objects ( with different FP's )
and sort them.<br>
</H4>
<H2>6 (EXTRA EXERCISE)</H2>
<H4>
Abstract Factory Design Pattern is for instance used when a system should be configured with one of more families of products.<br>
Papers from the book "Design Patterns" (GoF) will be handed out in class.<br>
Implement this pattern in C#!
</H4>
