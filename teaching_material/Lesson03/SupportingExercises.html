<h1><center>Supporting exercises - Lesson 3</center></h1>

<h2>1</h2><p>
<h4>Write and test an application with a class which inherits the Complex class from 
Lesson 2. The class could be a PolarForm class extending the Complex class. <br>
</h4>
<h2>2</h2><p>
<h4>
Write and test a class which uses simple file manipulation ( see chp. 20 for inspiration).<br>
Try to make this class as general as possible. Now the class can  be inherited from another
class which specialize the file manipulation class. <br>
</h4>
<h2>3</h2><p>
<h4>A singleton (GoF) pattern ensures that only one instance of a class can be active at a time. Try to create a class supporting this pattern. Hint: 
Use a static method and a private constructor.<br> 
</h4>
<h2>4</h2><p>
<h4>Reuse the inventory application from lesson 2:
Create some specialized classes that inherits from Article. Try to use the "is" and "as" keywords to place specialized articles on a separate list.<br>
</h4>
<h2>5</h2><p>
<h4>(Polymorphy) Team Danmark support many sport types.
A sport can be team sport or an individual sport.
Make a base class Sport with the following attributtes:<br>
<ul>
<li>string sportType</li>
<li>double amount </li>
</ul>
With the following methods:<br>
<ul>
<li>A constructor</li>
<li>PrintData</li>
</ul>
The classes HandBall, TableTennis (maybe others)
